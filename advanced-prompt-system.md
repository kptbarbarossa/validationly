## ðŸ”„ Dynamic Prompt Selection System

### Adaptive Prompting Based on Idea Type
```typescript
interface PromptStrategy {
  agents: string[];
  depth: 'shallow' | 'medium' | 'deep';
  specializations: string[];
  analysisTime: number;
}

const getPromptStrategy = (classification: IdeaClassification): PromptStrategy => {
  const strategies: Record<string, PromptStrategy> = {
    'SaaS-B2B-Enterprise': {
      agents: ['market', 'technical', 'financial', 'gtm', 'compliance'],
      depth: 'deep',
      specializations: ['enterprise-sales', 'security', 'integration'],
      analysisTime: 45
    },
    'E-commerce-B2C-Consumer': {
      agents: ['market', 'financial', 'gtm', 'logistics'],
      depth: 'medium',
      specializations: ['consumer-behavior', 'supply-chain', 'marketing'],
      analysisTime: 30
    },
    'FinTech-B2C-Consumer': {
      agents: ['market', 'technical', 'financial', 'compliance', 'security'],
      depth: 'deep',
      specializations: ['regulatory', 'security', 'banking-integration'],
      analysisTime: 60
    }
  };
  
  const key = `${classification.primaryCategory}-${classification.businessModel}-${classification.targetMarket}`;
  return strategies[key] || strategies['default'];
};
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Context-Aware Prompt Enhancement

### 1. Industry-Specific Context Injection
```typescript
const industryContexts = {
  'FinTech': {
    regulations: ['PCI DSS', 'KYC', 'AML', 'GDPR'],
    keyMetrics: ['AUM', 'Transaction Volume', 'Compliance Score'],
    competitors: ['Stripe', 'Square', 'PayPal', 'Plaid'],

    keyMetrics: ['Patient Outcomes', 'Clinical Efficacy', 'Safety Score'],
    competitors: ['Epic', 'Cerner', 'Teladoc', 'Veracyte'],
    trends: ['Telemedicine', 'AI Diagnostics', 'Wearables', 'Precision Medicine']
  }
};
```

### 2. Real-time Market Data Integration
```typescript
const enhancePromptWithMarketData = async (idea: string, category: string) => {
  const marketData = await Promise.all([
    getGoogleTrendsData(idea),
    getCompetitorAnalysis(category),
    getIndustryReports(category),
    getVCFundingData(category)
  ]);
  
  return {
    trendData: marketData[0],
    competitors: marketData[1],
    industryInsights: marketData[2],
    fundingLandscape: marketData[3]
  };
};
```

## ðŸ§  Advanced Prompt Techniques

- What are alternative solutions?
- What makes this solution unique?

STEP 3: MARKET ASSESSMENT
- How large is the potential market?
- Who are the key competitors?
- What market trends support or challenge this idea?

STEP 4: EXECUTION FEASIBILITY
- What resources are required?
- What are the key execution risks?
- What expertise is needed?

STEP 5: BUSINESS MODEL VIABILITY
- How will this make money?
- What are the unit economics?
- What's the path to profitability?

Based on this analysis, I'll provide a comprehensive validation score.

```

### 2. Few-Shot Learning with Success Examples
```typescript
const fewShotPrompt = `
Here are examples of how I analyze startup ideas:

EXAMPLE 1:
Idea: "Slack for remote teams"
Analysis: Strong problem (communication chaos), clear solution (organized messaging), large market (remote work trend), proven model (freemium SaaS)
Score: 85/100

EXAMPLE 2:  
Idea: "AI-powered legal document review"
Analysis: Real pain point (manual review time), AI solution feasible, large enterprise market, high switching costs
Score: 78/100

EXAMPLE 3:
Idea: "Social network for pet owners"
Analysis: Weak problem (existing solutions), unclear monetization, saturated social market, high user acquisition costs
Score: 35/100

Now analyze this idea using the same framework:
Idea: "${idea}"
`;
```

### 3. Adversarial Prompting for Robust Analysis
```typescript
const adversarialPrompt = `
You are now two AI experts debating this startup idea:

OPTIMIST AI: Find all the positive aspects, market opportunities, and success potential.
PESSIMIST AI: Identify all risks, challenges, and reasons why this might fail.

OPTIMIST: "${idea}" has great potential because...
PESSIMIST: But there are serious concerns about...
OPTIMIST: However, those concerns can be addressed by...
PESSIMIST: Even so, the fundamental challenges remain...

After this debate, provide a balanced analysis that considers both perspectives.

## ðŸ“Š Prompt Performance Optimization

### 1. A/B Testing Framework
```typescript
interface PromptVariant {
  id: string;
  prompt: string;
  performance: {
    accuracy: number;
    userSatisfaction: number;
    responseTime: number;
  };
}

const promptABTest = async (idea: string) => {
  const variants = [
    { id: 'detailed', prompt: detailedPrompt },
    { id: 'concise', prompt: concisePrompt },
    { id: 'structured', prompt: structuredPrompt }
  ];
  
  const results = await Promise.all(
    variants.map(variant => analyzeWithPrompt(idea, variant.prompt))
  );
  
  return selectBestResult(results);
};
```

### 2. Dynamic Prompt Optimization
```typescript
const optimizePrompt = (userFeedback: Feedback[], promptHistory: PromptHistory[]) => {
  const insights = analyzePerformancePatterns(userFeedback, promptHistory);
  
  return {
    adjustedTemperature: insights.optimalTemperature,
    enhancedInstructions: insights.missingInstructions,
    improvedExamples: insights.betterExamples,
    refinedStructure: insights.optimalStructure
  };
};
